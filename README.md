 Urban ecological environment quality evaluation using deep autoencoder integration of multisource remote sensing data
 
Urban Eco-Environmental Quality (UEEQ) plays a vital role in human well-being and ecosystem sustainability, yet its assessment remains challenging due to the complex interactions among multiple ecological, environmental, and social factors. To address this, we propose an innovative multi-source remote sensing assessment framework based on deep autoencoders, which systematically integrates diverse indicators to evaluate the spatiotemporal evolution and key driving forces of UEEQ in Beijing from 2015 to 2020. Compared to traditional methods, this framework offers enhanced comprehensiveness and adaptability in feature extraction, model training, and interpretability.

The algorithm and code for the UEEQ assessment based on autoencoder were implemented using the Python code, enabling nonlinear dimensionality reduction of multivariate ecological, environmental, and social data. The construction of the autoencoder framework and the dimensionality reduction process are detailed in the attached script Deep_autoencoder.py. For comparison and indirect validation of the UEEQ results, the calculation of the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) was conducted on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, with implementation details provided in the attached RSEI_MODIS (GEE JavaScript) file.
